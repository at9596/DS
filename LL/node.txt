LL is looks like a node which contains node(data) and next(pointer of next node). head pointer contains the address of the first node and 
last node points to a null node.



head -> |data! next| -> |d2!next|-> null

let's understand it by programming code-


java code:

class Node{
    int data;
    Node next;
    public Node(int data){
        this.data= data;
        this.next = null; // This is optional as inbuilt already intialized by null
    }
}
